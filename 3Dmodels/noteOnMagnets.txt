Magnet hole size notes:

magnets used are 5.0mm in diameter, but to fit them in plastic holes:
	5.2mm for tight fit (diameter)
	5.25 for a bit looser
	anything smaller and they won't go in
	anything larger and they fall out (5.3 sits well, but will fall out with a shake)
	recommend to use 5.25mm diameter holes
depth of hole should be 0.25mm + the height of the magnet
